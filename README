jq : A simple script to write a journal in a very UNIX way. The journal is
stored in a file hierarchy in the following way:

.jq :
    |-journal1
    |-journal2
        |-2015
        |-2016
            |-01
            |-02
                |-12
                |-18
                    |-13:02.txt

Entries are encrypted using GPG.
